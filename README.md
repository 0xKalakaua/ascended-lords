# Ascended Lords
Ascended Lords is an ERC-721 collection that is part of the [Fantom Lord Ecosystem](https://fantomlords.com/).

## Contract
The Ascended Lords is an ERC-721 contract featuring some unique functionalities summarized here:
- It requires the burning of 1 [Fantom Lord](https://paintswap.finance/marketplace/fantom/collections/fantom-lords) and 1 [Artifact](https://github.com/0xKalakaua/ftl-artifacts) in order to mint, thus the Fantom Lord is considered "Ascended".
- There are 8 different classes of Ascended Lord which correspond to the 8 different types of Artifacts. So depeding on which Artifact type you burn you will get a specific class of Ascended Lord. There is special class that ocurrs at random with a small percentage probability.
